An experimental web-bassed arcade real-time multiplayer game, resambling Nintendo's tanks game.

This project is my final assigment in order to complete my Master's degree.

The idea is to create a HTML5 based real-time multiplayer arcade game.
The player is presented a 2D bird's eye view over the scene. Each player controls a tank and has some sort of goal (e.g. get the golden eagle). The tank can destroy obstacles and other tanks on the screen.

The game is written in JavaScript. It usses a canvas for client-side animations, node.js for server-side control and collision detection and WebSockets for communication. PHP+MySQL are used for serving pages, keeping statistics and user management.
